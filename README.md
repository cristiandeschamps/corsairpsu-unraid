## Introduction
This plugin is a wrapper for [corsairmi](https://github.com/notaz/corsairmi) which reads out monitoring information for Corsair RMi and HXi power supplies. It is now also a wrapper for [cpsumon](https://github.com/audiohacked/cpsumon) for AXi PSUs.

Originally created by Realies, Modified by Fma965 for more accurate statistics, to match with the unraid dashboard styling and to add AXi support.
In this repository changes were made to get this plugin to work on UnRAID v.6.12.0-beta7 and above.
